  <h2>Important reported dates & progress notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bhoomi pujan / foundation stone: reported on 3 September 2025 (one report) and 5 September 2025 (another report); leaders reported present included Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini and Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar (reported).</li>
    <li>Site works: small works and piling have started; contractor began piling near the Sector 31 traffic signal and a casting yard beside Hero Honda Chowk was being prepared (reported).</li>
    <li>Planned schedule in one report: site work end‑2025; major construction 2026–2027; testing 2028; public operations around 2029. Other reporting aligns Phase 1 structural completion within 30 months from contract start (reported).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sectors 5 → Gurugram Railway Station spur (detailed)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Length: 1.8 km (reported). Estimated cost: Rs 450 crore (reported).</li>
    <li>Status: RITES DPR/study reportedly completed; proposal to be sent to GMRL board, then Haryana government and Union Ministry for approval; planned inclusion in Phase 2 tender once approved (reported).</li>
    <li>Land needs for Railway Station entry/exit: total ~1,069 sq m (419 sq m government land; 446 sq m private land; 204 sq m railway land). Sector 5 station area needs ~605 sq m more (reported).</li>
    <li>Earlier option: skywalk with escalators; state decided dedicated metro spur preferable to boost ridership and connectivity (reported).</li>
    <li>Separately, an HMRTC DPR for a Bhondsi–Gurugram railway station line is being prepared; with this spur the Bhondsi line may terminate at Sector 5 (reported).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Construction setup & technology</h2>
  <p>On‑site preparations include a three‑hectare casting yard producing precast U‑girders, pier caps and viaduct segments. Load testing on piles is underway; full piling will follow clearance. Contractor planned facilities for over 1,200 workers in two shifts to enable near‑round‑the‑clock construction. Signalling is reported to use CBTC for safety and precise train control.</p>

  <h2>Land acquisition policy (reported)</h2>
  <p>Haryana approved a new land acquisition policy for the Gurugram Metro expansion (reported highlights): GMRL authorised to buy private land by negotiated settlement (direct purchase); an 11‑member Land Acquisition Committee chaired by the Gurugram Deputy Commissioner will oversee negotiations; purchase price to be consolidated and include compensation and rehabilitation as per RFCTLARR Act schedules; no extra R&R beyond negotiated price for titleholders; non‑titleholders handled separately. The process involves site inspection → committee review → public notice → negotiation & purchase → transfer, etc. (reported).</p>

  <h2>Other network expansions mentioned (reported)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ballabgarh → Palwal: techno‑feasibility underway; ~25 km, ~10 stations (reported).</li>
    <li>Vatika Chowk → Pachgaon: DPR underway; ~30 km (reported).</li>
    <li>Sector 45 (Gurgaon) → Bata Chowk (Faridabad): ~31 km corridor planned (reported).</li>
    <li>Millennium City Centre → Gurgaon Railway Station: alternate route ~11.15 km passing Rajiv Chowk, Subhash Chowk and New Colony Mor (reported).</li>
    <li>Sector 56 → Pachgaon: new 35.2 km line with 28 stations; estimated cost ~Rs 8,500 crore; Haryana to fund most and seek a 10% central grant; will link to RRTS at Kherki Daula and Pachgaon (reported).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Gurugram Railway Station redevelopment (EPC project)</h2>
  <p>Reported EPC redevelopment elements: Main Station Building (height 41.3 m), air concourse, through roof, foot over bridge, multi‑level car parking (24.8 m), platform refurbishment, sewage & water treatment, rainwater harvesting and structural glazing. Project targets IGBC Platinum rating and includes sustainable passenger‑experience upgrades (reported).</p>

  <h2>Real‑world effects and practical notes</h2>
  <p>Officials expect the corridor to better connect New and Old Gurugram, improve mobility and stimulate economic and real estate activity in Old Gurugram (reported). Reported property price ranges: Sector 4 buying Rs 4,600–7,600 / sq ft (rent Rs 9–15 / sq ft); Palam Vihar buying Rs 7,700–12,000 / sq ft (rent Rs 13–21 / sq ft); Sector 9 buying Rs 5,993–6,351 / sq ft; Ashok Vihar buying Rs 6,027–6,112 / sq ft (reported).</p>
  <p>Interoperability: reports say travel will be possible with Delhi Metro cards; interchange with Delhi Metro Yellow Line at HUDA City Centre and Rapid Metro at Cyber City. One article described Gurugram Metro as "first privately owned and operated metro project in India" — this is an attributed claim in media reports and should be treated as reported (unverified here).</p>

  <h2>What’s confirmed vs reported (guidance)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirmed (strongly reported across sources): project approved; GMRL as executing agency; 27 stations approved; construction site works (casting yard, piling) underway; RITES DPR prepared for Sector 5 spur (reported consistently).</li>
    <li>Reported / unverified / conflicting across outlets: exact total project cost (Rs 6,800 crore vs Rs 5,452.72 crore breakdown), Phase 1 cost/tender figures (Rs 1,286 crore vs INR 1,503 crore contract), bhoomi pujan date (3 Sept vs 5 Sept 2025), ridership projections and the "first privately owned" ownership claim. Treat these as provisional until official GMRL/state/central releases confirm.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary (plainly)</h2>
  <p>In short: the Gurugram Metro corridor (~28.5 km, 27 stations) is approved and early construction activity has begun. Key immediate items: Phase 1 civil contract reportedly awarded with a Sep 2025 start target; a separate 1.8 km, Rs 450 crore Sector 5 → Gurugram Railway Station spur has a RITES DPR and awaits board/government approvals; multiple cost, date and ridership figures are reported differently by outlets and should be treated as provisional until official releases clarify them. I can convert this into a one‑page timeline diagram or a compact station map summary on request.</p>
